	<h1>Pig Aggregator</h1>
	<h2>Decription</h2>
	<p>Pig Aggregator is an action that allows data to be
		aggregated.</p>
	<h3>Quick Guide</h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Input
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
			    onclick="return false;" 
			    href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
			    Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory
			</a>
		    </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Configurations
		<ul>
		    <li>Group By - Group the dataset by a selection of features</li>
		    <li> Transform data related to the group by</li>
		    <li> Sort data </li>
		    <li> Filter data row per row</li>
		    <li> Choose data format </li>
		    <li> Perform audit on the result </li>

	    </li>
	    <li>Output
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
			    onclick="return false;" 
			    href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
			    Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory
			</a>
		    </li>
		    <li>audit (OPT): 
			<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
			    onclick="return false;" 
			    href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
			    Control-A delimited directory 
			</a> with global audit values

		</ul>
	    </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2><a id="page1">Group By - Page 1</a></h2>

	<p>In Group By the group by condition can be set to group the data
		set by an attribute. When nothing is selected, the data set will be
		aggregated in one row.</p>

	<h2><a id="page2">Feature Operations - Page 2</a></h2>

	<p>Feature operations allows data to be copied to the output table
		and also to do some transformations of the data. It allows casting of one
		data type to another type or other operations to the attribute.
	   Operations can be process over a list of rows defined by the group by
	   clause.
	</p>
	<p>Generator options are:
	    <ul>
		<li>copy - copy the features that are grouped by</li>
		<li>AVG - calculate the average on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>COUNT - count the number of non null values on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>COUNT_DISTINCT - count the number of distinct values on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>MAX - calculate the maximum value on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>MIN - calculate the minimum value on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>SUM - calculate the sum on every aggregated number features</li>
		<li>AUDIT - same as generate AVG, COUNT, COUNT_DISTINCT, MAX,
		MIN and SUM</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>


	<h2><a id="page3">Ordering dataset - Page 2</a></h2>

	<p>In this page you can order the features at your convenience. If
	nothing is specified the data set will not be ordered.</p>

	<h2><a id="page4">Filtering, Formating and Auditing - Page 3</a></h2>

	<h3>Condition</h3>
	<p>Conditions can be set to filter out the row of interest. The filter is applied row per row 		indepently. The query can be as complicated  or as complex as needed.
	</p>

	<h3>Parallel</h3>

	<p> The parallel clause lets you choose the number of reducers used when ordering the dataset. This 	  parameter is optional and useful if you have performance issues. Please read the performance guide, 
	parallel section of the pig documentation.
	</p>

	<h3>Delimiter</h3>

	<p> Choose the delimiter character used to separate the output dataset field in each row. The 		delimiter is used only if you choose Text format.
	</p> 
	<h3>Format</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li> Text: save the result in a text format which is user readable, very handy for re-using the output</li>
	<li> Binary: Use pig binary format. Binary format for reading and writing is a bit faster than a text 		     format.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Audit</h3>

	When the audit is enabled a second data set is generated with aggregate
	value that can give an overview to the user. For each column
	when relevant the range, the average, the number of non-null
	and null values as well as the number of distinct values (only for
	CATEGORY type) are calculated.



	<h2>Red Sqirl Pig</h2>
	<p>
		Red Sqirl Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
			target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the Red Sqirl platform to perform
		    Pig actions.
		   
		   The pig actions available from the package are
		   <ul>
		       <li> Pig Aggregator 
		       </li>
			<li>
			    Pig Anonymise
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Binary Source
			</li>
		       <li>
			    Pig Join
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Sample
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Select
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Text Source
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Transpose
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Unanonymise
			</li>
			<li>
			     Pig Union 
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Value Binning
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Volume Binning
			</li>
		   </ul>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Redsqirl Pig Data set</h3>

	<p>The last page of every pig action will have two interactions
		that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
		to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
		the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
		REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY
	</p>

	<h3>Auditing</h3>
	
	<p> After each Pig action it is possible to audit the result in order to
	have a better idea of the data set and help make decisions on what to
	do next. For example you may want to do an audit before using a binning
	node in order to have an idea of your value range. Also result of the
	audit may create auto-generated options.
	</p>

	<h3>Apache Pig</h3>

	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
		of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
		implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
		language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
		Latin, which has the following key properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
			execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
			Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
			transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
			making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
		<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
			encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
			automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
			efficiency.</li>
		<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
			special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
