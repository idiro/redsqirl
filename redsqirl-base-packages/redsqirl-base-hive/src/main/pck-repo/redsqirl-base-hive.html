		<a href="http://hive.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hive</a> is a hadoop implementation
		of a relational database that is used for data warehousing for large
		data sets. Each query written in it's own language called HiveQl that
		acts like a normal SQL query but runs as a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is
		made easier and makes querying large datasets quicker and more
		efficient.
