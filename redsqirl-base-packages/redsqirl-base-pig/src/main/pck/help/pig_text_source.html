    <h1>Pig Text Source</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pig Text Source is an action that defines a Map/Reduce text directory source.</p>
    <h3>Quick Guide</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
	<li>Browser        
	    <ul>
		<li>Path - Path to the Text MapReduce directory</li>
		<li>Header - Set header and delimiter</li>
		<li>Table Preview - Preview the table</li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Output
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    <a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
		onclick="return false;" 
		href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
		Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory
	    </a>
	    </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><a id="page1">Choose path - Page 1</a></h2>

    <h3> Path </h3>

    Choose the data set path. By default in Red Sqirl a Map/Reduce text
    directory will have the extension ".mrtxt", however you can select any file
    by removing the filter.

    <h3>Options</h3>

    <ul>
	<li>You can change the header of a file a header can be a list of
	feature name or a list of feature name with type. For example, if I have
	a data set that contains three fields. I could defined the header to be
	"field1, field2, field3" or "field1 DATE, field2 STRING, field3 INT".
	</li>
	<li>You can change the delimiter. The delimiter can be a normal
	character (",","|",";") or an ASCII character in which case (#1,
	#44)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Red Sqirl Pig</h2>
    <p>
    Red Sqirl Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
	target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the Red Sqirl platform to perform
    Pig actions.

    The pig actions available from the package are
    <ul>
	<li> Pig Aggregator 
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Anonymise
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Binary Source
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Join
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Sample
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Select
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Text Source
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Transpose
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Unanonymise
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Union 
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Value Binning
	</li>
	<li>
	Pig Volume Binning
	</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Redsqirl Pig Data set</h3>

    <p>The last page of every pig action will have two interactions
    that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
    to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
    the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
    REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY
    </p>

    <h3>Auditing</h3>

    <p> After each Pig action it is possible to audit the result in order to
    have a better idea of the data set and help make decisions on what to
    do next. For example you may want to do an audit before using a binning
    node in order to have an idea of your value range. Also result of the
    audit may create auto-generated options.
    </p>

    <h3>Apache Pig</h3>

    <p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
    consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
    programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
    The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
    amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
    to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
    infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
    of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
    implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
    language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
    Latin, which has the following key properties:
    <ul>
	<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
	execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
	Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
	transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
	making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
	<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
	encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
	automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
	efficiency.</li>
	<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
	special-purpose processing.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
