    <h1>Pig Transpose</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The transpose action is similar to a Matrix transpose. Every row becomes
    a column and every column a row. This operation will be successful only on a
    very small amount of data. In order to configure this action you need to know
    how many row contains your input data set.</p>

<h3>Quick Guide</h3>
	<p>

	<ul>
	    <li>Input
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
			    onclick="return false;" 
			    href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
			    Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory
			</a>
		    </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Configurations
		<ul>
		    <li>Features - Features to be included in the transpose</li>
		    <li>Choose the new features name</li>
		    <li>Choose data format </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Output
		<ul>
		    <li>
			<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_canvas" 
			    onclick="return false;" 
			    href="../help/canvas.html#output_type">
			    Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory
			</a>
		    </li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	</ul>
   
	<h2><a id="page1">Fields to Transpose - Page 1</a></h2>
    <p>This page lets you choose the features to include in the transpose. The
    number of features picked is the number of rows. The row order is
    independent from the interactions and depends only of the input data field
    order.</p>
    
    <h2><a id="page2">New Feature Names and Format - Page 2</a></h2>
    
    <h3>New Feature Names</h3>

	<p>This page lets you choose the new feature names.</p>

	<h3>Delimiter</h3>

	<p> Choose the delimiter character used to separate the output dataset field in each row. The 		delimiter is used only if you choose Text format.
	</p> 
	<h3>Format</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li> Text: save the result in a text format which is user readable, very handy for re-using the output</li>
	<li> Binary: Use pig binary format. Binary format for reading and writing is a bit faster than a text 		     format.</li>
	</ul>
	

    <h2>Red Sqirl Pig</h2>
	<p>
		Red Sqirl Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
			target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the Red Sqirl platform to perform
		    Pig actions.
		   
		   The pig actions available from the package are
		   <ul>
		       <li> <a class="stopLink" id="help_pig_aggregator"
			   onclick="return false;" href="pig_aggregator.html">Pig Aggregator</a>

	<h3>Redsqirl Pig Data set</h3>

	<p>The last page of every pig action will have two interactions
		that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
		to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
		the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
		REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY
	</p>

	<h3>Auditing</h3>
	
	<p> After each Pig action it is possible to audit the result in order to
	have a better idea of the data set and help make decisions on what to
	do next. For example you may want to do an audit before using a binning
	node in order to have an idea of your value range. Also result of the
	audit may create auto-generated options.
	</p>

	<h3>Apache Pig</h3>

	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
		of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
		implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
		language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
		Latin, which has the following key properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
			execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
			Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
			transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
			making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
		<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
			encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
			automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
			efficiency.</li>
		<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
			special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
