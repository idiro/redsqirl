    <h1>Red Sqirl Pig</h1>
    <p>
        Red Sqirl Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
            target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the Red Sqirl platform to perform
            Pig actions.
           
           The pig actions available from the package are
           <ul>
               <li> Pig Aggregator 
               </li>
            <li>
                Pig Anonymise
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Binary Source
            </li>
               <li>
                Pig Join
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Sample
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Select
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Transpose
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Unanonymise
            </li>
            <li>
                 Pig Union 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Value Binning
            </li>
            <li>
                Pig Volume Binning
            </li>
           </ul>

    <h2>Redsqirl Pig Data set</h2>

    <p>The last page of every pig action will have two interactions
        that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
        to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
        the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
        REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY
    </p>

    <h2>Auditing</h2>
    
    <p> After each Pig action it is possible to audit the result in order to
    have a better idea of the data set and help make decisions on what to
    do next. For example you may want to do an audit before using a binning
    node in order to have an idea of your value range. Also result of the
    audit may create auto-generated options.
    </p>

    <h2>Apache Pig</h2>

    <p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
        consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
        programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
        The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
        amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
        to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
        infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
        of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
        implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
        language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
        Latin, which has the following key properties:
    <ul>
        <li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
            execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
            Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
            transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
            making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
        <li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
            encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
            automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
            efficiency.</li>
        <li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
            special-purpose processing.</li>
    </ul>
