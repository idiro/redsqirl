	<h1>Process Manager</h1>
	<p>The Process Manager is a way to view the list of jobs that have
		been submitted to Oozie . It is also possible to kill processes that
		are running. There is also a link to the Oozie Web Console that will
		show more details about the jobs submitted to Oozie.</p>
	<p>A job can also be manipulated from this tab
	<ul>
	    <li>Kill: Stop a job. The current running action
	    status will be set to 'kill'.</li>
	    <li>Suspend: Suspend the job until you resume it. It is useful if
	    the cluster is busy and you want to prioritize the jobs.</li>
	    <li>Resume: Resume a suspended job.</li>
