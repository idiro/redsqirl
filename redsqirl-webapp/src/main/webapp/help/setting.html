	<h1>Settings</h1>

	<p>The setting view contain all the parameters regarding Red Sqirl core
	functionalities. For viewing package related parameters you should go to
	the package view - button on the bottom right. Settings are organised
	into hierarchical sections.</p>

	<p>The settings have two scopes, System on the left - shared by
	everybody - and User. User settings will always
	overwrite system one if they are both present.</p>

	<p>Each setting comes with a label and a description (when you
	hover an input field).</p>
