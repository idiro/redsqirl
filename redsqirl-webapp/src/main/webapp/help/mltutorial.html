  <h1>Machine Learning Tutorial</h1>

  <p>This workflow will demonstarte how to run a Logistic Regression in Red
  Sqirl. The Spark Logistic Regression from the SparkML package or the Hama
  Logistic Regression from the Hama package can be used.
  </p>

  <p>You will need two files to complete this tutorial.
  <ul>
      <li>ml_tutorial_training_data.txt</li>
      <li>ml_tutorial_prediction_data.txt</li>
  </ul>
  Transfer these files onto the hadoop file system into two new
  directories.
  </p>      

  <h2>Hama/Spark Workflow</h2>


  <p>This workflow will demonstrate the Hama/Spark
  Logistic regression action. This action allows us to run logistic
  regression over a data set. It&rsquo;s inputs are the training
  set and the prediction dataset. That means that two source
  actions are needed.</p>

  <p> Use &ldquo;,&rdquo; as the delimiter and
  &ldquo;ID STRING, SEPAL_LENGTH FLOAT, SEPAL_WIDTH FLOAT, PETAL_LENGTH FLOAT,
  PETAL_WIDTH FLOAT, SPECIES CATEGORY &rdquo; as the header in both source
  actions.</p>

  

  <ul>
    <li>Create a new canvas by clicking the
    plus symbol on the canvas tabs bar</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>create the two source actions with the
    two files provided</li>

    <li>On the actions footer below click the
    actions property Icon</li>

    <li>Either edit the current actions tab by
    click the title of it or create a new tab by inputting the new
    tab title in the field provided and click the &ldquo;i&rdquo;
    symbol</li>

    <li>once in a configurable tab , click the
    checkbox beside &ldquo;hama_logistic_regression&rdquo;/&ldquo;spark_logistic_regression&rdquo; and then
    ok</li>

    <li>make sure you are on tab that was just
    configures to include hama/spark logistic regression and drag it to
    the canvas</li>

    <li>select the source that is set to use
    the training file and create a link to the
    new &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo;/&ldquo;spark LR&rdquo; action.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>a new window should appear and ask you to
    select whether it is a training data set or a prediction data
    set, select training and then click ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>select the source that is set to use
    the prediction file and create a link to the
    &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo;/&ldquo;spark LR&rdquo; action</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>in this window select prediction and then
    click ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>once the &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo;/&ldquo;spark LR&rdquo; action
    has the two required inputs , open it and change the element id
    if required</li>

    <li>the first page with list three
    interactions : Label , ID and Label Value.</li>

    <li>in the Label interaction select
    churner</li>

    <li>in the Id interaction select
    ID</li> 

    <li>finally in the Label Value interaction
    input &ldquo;Iris-setosa&rdquo; as the value without quotes.</li>

    <li>click next to see the Model settings
    such as predictors and parameters for running the
    model.</li>

    <li>For the purposes of the tutorial we
    will leave these interactions alone and just click next and
    ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Run the workflow</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h3>Summary of workflow</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>added actions to an actions
    tab</li>

    <li>labeled the inputs for logistic
    regression</li>

    <li>configured and ran a logistic
    regression</li>
  </ul>
