	<h1>Models</h1>

	<p>The model view gather all the models installed on your Red Sqirl
	instance.</p>

	<p>Models are data process blocks build out of Red Sqirl packages. A
	model can produce a prediction, a report or an analyses. A model is
	composed of SuperActions that can depend on each other.</p>

	<h2>Scope</h2>

	<p>Two scopes of model installation exists
	<ul>
	    <li>System: The system scope is shared with everybody.</li>
	    <li>User: The user scope allow the installation of personal extra
	    functionality.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The user scope models overwrite system ones when there is a
	conflict. For example if a model churn_model with a super action
	evaluation is installed on the
	System scope and the user 'brian' has installed version 2 on its user
	scope that does have an evaluation super action. Brian won't be able to
	use the evaluation</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>In order to install system models, you need to be an administrator
	and therefore be in the according <a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_setting" onclick="return
	    false;" href="../help/setting.html">setting</a>.</p>

	<p>You can install new models either from the Analytics
	Store or from HDFS.

	<h3>Analytics Store</h3>
	<p>You can use the Analytics Store only if your web server can reach it. 
	<ol>
	    <li>Click Install either in the System scope column or User Scope
	    column</li>
	    <li>Sign In with your Analytics Store credentials, if you do not
	    have an account, you can create one on the spot</li>
	    <li>Find the package you would like to install</li>
	    <li>Click install</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>From HDFS</h3>

	<p>A model is a simple zip file that should have a name
	$name-$version.zip</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Click import either in the System scope column or User Scope
	    column</li>
	    <li>Choose the HDFS path in which your model exist</li>
	    <li>Click OK</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Model Privileges</h2>

	<p>Models and their Super Action can be protected from their editors.
	Three range of permission exists for a model.
	<ul>
	    <li>public: anyone can view and modify the source</li>
	    <li>run only: the version installed is not viewable nor
	    editable</li>
	    <li>licensed: as above, but force the installation to be done
	    through the Analytics Store</li>
	</ul>
	run only and editable privileges can be set when you export the model to HDFS. When
	you do so, be careful to always keep the original as the copy cannot be
	modified.
