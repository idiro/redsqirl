	<h2>Red Sqirl Pig</h2>
	<p>
		Red Sqirl Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
			target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the Red Sqirl platform to perform
		    Pig actions.
		   
		   The pig actions available from the package are
		   <ul>
		       <li> Pig Aggregator 
		       </li>
			<li>
			    Pig Anonymise
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Binary Source
			</li>
		       <li>
			    Pig Join
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Sample
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Select
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Text Source
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Transpose
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Unanonymise
			</li>
			<li>
			     Pig Union 
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Value Binning
			</li>
			<li>
			    Pig Volume Binning
			</li>
		   </ul>

	</p>
	
	<h3>Redsqirl Pig Data set</h3>

	<p>The last page of every pig action will have two interactions
		that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
		to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
		the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
		REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY
	</p>

	<h3>Auditing</h3>
	
	<p> After each Pig action it is possible to audit the result in order to
	have a better idea of the data set and help make decisions on what to
	do next. For example you may want to do an audit before using a binning
	node in order to have an idea of your value range. Also result of the
	audit may create auto-generated options.
	</p>

	<h3>Apache Pig</h3>

	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
		of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
		implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
		language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
		Latin, which has the following key properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
			execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
			Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
			transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
			making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
		<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
			encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
			automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
			efficiency.</li>
		<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
			special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
