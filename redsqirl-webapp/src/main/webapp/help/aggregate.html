	<h1>Aggregate</h1>

	<p>Aggregate is the easiest way to create Super Actions. Super Actions
	are a logical group of actions, they have a name and are included into a
	<a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_modelview" onclick="return false;"
	    href="../help/modelview.html">model</a>. Super Actions can be reused
	in any other workflow and included into the user's <a class="stopLink"
	    id="helpmain_actfooter" onclick="return false;"
	    href="../help/actionsfooter.html">footer</a>.</p>

	<p>Aggregate will always install the element in the user scope. You can
	choose the model name under which the Super Action is installed. In a
	Super Action inputs and outputs have to be declare, their name have to
	unique and smaller than 15 characters. A short comment can be added
	optionnaly to guide future uses.</p>

	<p>In order to modify a Super Action, the easiest way is to:
	<ol>
	    <li>Drag and drop the action on a canvas. </li>
	    <li>Hover the Super Action, Options>Edit Super Action.</li>
	    <li>Do the modifications you want, it can include more comments in
	    the <a class="stopLink"
	    id="helpmain_commenteditor" onclick="return false;"
	    href="../help/commentEditor.html">Comment Editor</a>.</li>
	    <li>Go into Software>Install Sub-workflow</li>
	</ol>
