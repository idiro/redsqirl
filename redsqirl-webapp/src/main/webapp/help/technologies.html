	<h2><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a></h2>
	<p>Hadoop is a distrubuted system that is implemented over a cluster
		of computers. There can be many nodes in a cluster but there can only
		be one control node known as namenode. A cluster can contain many nodes
		that are slaves to the namenode these are known as datanodes. These
		datanodes can usually hold the storage space for HDFS or Hive but also
		have resources to perform processes like Map/Reduce</p>
	<h2><a href="http://hive.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hive</a></h2>
	<p>Hive is a Hadoop implementation of a relational database that is
		used for data warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in
		its own language called HiveQl, acts like a normal SQL query but
		runs as a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is made easier and makes querying
		large datasets quicker and more efficient</p>
	<h2><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html" target="_blank">HDFS</a></h2>
	<p>HDFS is the distributed storage facility that is included within
		Hadoop. Any datanode that is in the cluster and configured to use HDFS
		will be a replication of all other datanodes, this means that all data
		are synchronized across the cluster. In the event that a datanode has
		to be excluded from the cluster, the data that is stored on that
		datanode is already available within the cluster.</p>
	<h2><a href="http://oozie.apache.org/" target="_blank">Oozie</a></h2>

	<p>It can be difficult to run a chain of processes together, but Oozie
		is technology that provides workflow functionality to the processes
		available in Hadoop. </p>
	<p>Oozie also provides functionality to manage workflows. Through
	Oozie and the Red Sqirl Process Manager tab, you can review job details
	and control running jobs.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://pig.apache.org/" target="_blank">Pig</a></h2>


	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets, which
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
		of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
		implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
		language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
		Latin, which has the following key properties:
