	<h1>Packages</h1>

	<p>The package view gather all the packages installed on your Red Sqirl
	instance.</p>

	<p>Packages are groups of actions that are used to perform
	specific processes on Red Sqirl. They generally run on the same
	platform e.g. Pig, Hive.</p>

	<h2>Scope</h2>

	<p>Two scopes of package installation exists
	<ul>
	    <li>System: The system scope is shared with everybody.</li>
	    <li>User: The user scope allow the installation of personal extra
	    functionality.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The user scope packages overwrite system ones when there is a
	conflict. For example if Red Sqirl Pig version 1 is installed on the
	System scope and the user 'brian' has installed version 2 on its user
	scope. Version 1 will be used for every user but 'brian' who will use
	version 2.</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>In order to install system packages, you need to be an administrator
	and therefore be in the according <a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_setting" onclick="return false;" href="../help/setting.html">setting</a>. To
	install user packages, the user package setting should be set to true.</p>

	<p>If your web server can reach the Analytics Store, you can easily
	install a new functionality. 
	<ol>
	    <li>Click Install either in the System scope column or User Scope
	    column</li>
	    <li>Sign In with your Analytics Store credentials, if you do not
	    have an account, you can create one on the spot</li>
	    <li>Find the package you would like to install</li>
	    <li>Click install</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Settings</h2>

	<p>A package may comes with its own settings. You could access to them
	through this view. Settings can also have two scopes, those scope are
	independent from the scope of the package. Similarly, user scope
	overwrite system scope. If you want to know more about settings please
	refer to the <a class="stopLink" id="helpmain_setting" onclick="return false;" href="../help/setting.html">setting page</a>.</p>
