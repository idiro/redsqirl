  <h1>Hama Tutorial</h1>

  <h2>Hama Workflow</h2>

  

  <p>This workflow will demonstrate the Hama
  Logistic regression action. This action allows us to run logistic
  regression over a data set. It&rsquo;s inputs are the training
  set and the prediction dataset. That means that two source
  actions are needed.</p>

  <p>There are two files in the /tmp/ directory
  on keane called training.txt and the other prediction.txt.
  Transfer these files onto the hadoop file system into two new
  directories as performed in the previous tutorial. Use
  &ldquo;,&rdquo; as the delimiter in both source actions but use
  &ldquo;id STRING , height FLOAT, colour String, age INT , churner
  INT&rdquo; as the header for the &ldquo;training,txt&rdquo; file,
  and use &ldquo;id STRING , height FLOAT, colour String, age
  INT&rdquo; as the header for the &ldquo;prediction.txt&rdquo;
  file,</p>

  

  <ul>
    <li>Create a new canvas by clicking the
    plus symbol on the canvas tabs bar</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>create the two source actions with the
    two files provided on keane</li>

    <li>On the actions footer below click the
    actions property Icon</li>

    <li>Either edit the current actions tab by
    click the title of it or create a new tab by inputting the new
    tab title in the field provided and click the &ldquo;i&rdquo;
    symbol</li>

    <li>once in a configurable tab , click the
    checkbox beside &ldquo;hama_logistic_regression&rdquo; and then
    ok</li>

    <li>make sure you are on tab that was just
    configures to include hama logistic regression and drag it to
    the canvas</li>

    <li>select the source that is set to use
    the &ldquo;training.txt&rdquo; file and create a link to the
    new &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo; action.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>a new window should appear and ask you to
    select whether it is a training data set or a prediction data
    set, select training and then click ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>select the source that is set to use
    the &ldquo;prediction.txt&rdquo; file and create a link to the
    &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo; action</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>in this window select prediction and then
    click ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>once the &ldquo;hama LR&rdquo; action
    has the two required inputs , open it and change the element id
    if required</li>

    <li>the first page with list three
    interactions : Label , ID and Label Value.</li>

    <li>in the Label interaction select
    churner</li>

    <li>in the Id interaction select
    id</li>

    <li>finally in the Label Value interaction
    input 1 as the value</li>

    <li>click next to see the Model settings
    such as predictors and parameters for running the
    model.</li>

    <li>For the purposes of the is tutorial we
    will leave these interactions alone and just click next and
    ok</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Run the workflow</li>
  </ul>

  

  <h3>Summary of workflow</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>added actions to an actions
    tab</li>

    <li>labeled the inputs for logistic
    regression</li>

    <li>configured and ran a logistic
    regression</li>
  </ul>
