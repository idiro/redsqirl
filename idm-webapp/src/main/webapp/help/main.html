	<h1>IDM</h1>
	<h2>
		<a id="stopLink" onclick="return false;" href="../help/technologies.html">Technologies</a>
	</h2>
	<p>IDM is an Analysis Platform that runs in parallel with the
		Hadoop platform and other Hadoop Technologies. The main technologies
		for storage are Hive and HDFS. Hadoop is a distributed system that
		allows for MapReduce processes to be run over the data that is stored
		in these technologies.</p>
	<p>The technologies involved in data manipulation are Pig and Hive
		, they can query the data and apply filters. Hive and HDFS are the
		storage technologies that are available. Oozie manages workflows so
		they can be run in parralel to other jobs. These jobs can be saved and
		be used again in the future. Saved jobs can be open and modified to be
		run with different parameters. The output of theses jobs will be saved
		to appropriate storage facility (Hive or HDFS)
	<h2>
		<a id="stopLink" onclick="return false;" href="../help/menu.html">Menu</a>
	</h2>
	<p>The Menu contains basic operations for manipulating workflow and
		projects. Options like new , save and run project can be found here.
		The logout button can also be found here.</p>


	<h2>
		<a id="stopLink" onclick="return false;" href="../help/canvas.html">Canvas</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		The canvas is where a <a href="../helpimages/Workflow.png"  target="_blank">Workflow</a>
		is contained which is used in IDM to manage a jobs processes or flow.
		A worklow is a build up of processes that chain together that perform
		corrective actions that produce a desired output. It is a way of
		managing a job so that each aspect of the job can be modified to use
		desired parameters.
	</p>

	<p>The canvas is a graphic representation of a workflow, this will
		shows the stages of the workflow so that it will help the user can
		create a workflow with the right steps involved at the right stage.
	<h2>
		<a id="stopLink" onclick="return false;" href="../help/actionsfooter.html">Actions Footer</a>
	</h2>
	<p>Actions footer is a container for tabs that hold actions that
		can be added to the workflow. Tabs can be created and be organized to
		hold certain actions.
	<h2>
		<a id="stopLink" onclick="return false;" href="../help/informaton.html">Information Panel</a>
	</h2>
	<p>This is where information can be view and different aspects of
		the IDM such as Oozie processes, Hadoop File System View and other
		informative views.</p>
