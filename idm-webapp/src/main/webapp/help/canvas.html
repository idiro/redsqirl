	<p>The canvas area is designated to build workflows, theses
		workflows that are used in IDM are controlled by Oozie to run jobs. A
		workflow can contain many linked actions that produce results. When an
		action is added to the canvas it will have an auto generated name
		which can be renamed. This new action must be configured to ensure
		that the workflow will run correctly. Source should be the first
		action that is added to the workflow, this action will identify the
		type and source location of the data. From there linking actions
		together is now possible. Linking actions together depends on what the
		input and output types of each action is. To link a source and and
		Hive action together, the source data type has to be Hive .</p>
