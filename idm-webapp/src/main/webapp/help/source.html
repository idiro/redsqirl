	<h1>Source</h1>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Source is an action that defines a data source for a workflow. A
		data source can come from a type of sorage facility. There are two
		types of storage facilities: Hive and HDFS.</p>
	<h3>
		<a href="../helpimages/DataType.png"> Data Type - Page 1</a>
	</h3>
	<p>Data type is where the data storage facility is chosen. As
		mentioned before the only options are Hive and HDFS.</p>

	<h4>Hive</h4>
	<p>Hive is a relational database that is used on Hadoop. It has a
		query language that can used like any other SQL.</p>

	<h4>HDFS</h4>
	<p>HDFS is the file system that is used on Hadoop. HDFS stands for
		Hadoop Distributed File System.</p>

	<h3>Data Sub-Type - Page 2</h3>
	<p>With each data type there are data sub-types. These are specific
		to the parent (data type)</p>

	<h3>

	</h3>
	<h5>Hive Table
	</h3>
	<p>A Hive table is table that is stored in Hive and is similar to
		the table that is stored in other RMDB (Oracle)</p>

	<h5>
		Hive Partition
		</h3>
		<p>A Hive partition is a similar to a table except it is stored so
			that partition can be filtered based on a condition (i.e income
			greater that 50000)</p>

		<h5>Data File</h5>
		<p>A Data File is the specific file that is to be used as the data
			source</p>

		<h5>Text Map Reduce Directory</h5>
		<p>Text Map Reduce Directory is the directory that is to be used
			that contains the data. The directory will contain all the data that
			a map reduce job will output</p>

		<h5>Binary Map Reduce Directory</h5>
		<p>Binary Map Reduce Directory is a directory of a map reduce job
			that stores the values in format.</p>
	<h3>Browser - Page 3</h3>
	<h5>
		<a href="../helpimages/BrowserSelect.png">Select Data</a>
	</h5>
	<p>Browser is where the data source can be selected b browsing
		(depending on Data Type). The directory/table/file must be selected
		for the screen to progress</p>

	<h5>
		<a href="../helpimages/BrowserAttributes.png">Browser Attributes</a>
	</h5>
	<p>After the data source has been selected the data format can be
		viewed and modified. Column names can be renamed and also view what type of data the colmun will store</p>
