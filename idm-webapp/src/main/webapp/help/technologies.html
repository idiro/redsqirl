	<h2><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a></h2>
	<p>Hadoop is distrubuted system that is implemented over a cluster
		of computers. There can be many nodes in a cluster but there can only
		be one control node known as namnode. A cluster can contain many nodes
		that are slaves to the namenode these are known as datanodes. These
		datanodes can usually hold the storage space for HDFS or Hive but also
		has resources to perform processes like Map/Reduce</p>
	<h2><a href="http://hive.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hive</a></h2>
	<p>Hive is a hadoop implementation of a relational database that is
		used for data warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in
		it's own language called HiveQl that acts like a normal SQL query but
		runs as a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is made easier and makes querying
		large datasets quicker and more efficient</p>
	<h2><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html" target="_blank">HDFS</a></h2>
	<p>HDFS is the distributed storage facility that is included within
		hadoop. Any datanode that is in the cluster and configured to use HDFS
		will be a replication of all other datanode , this means that all data
		is synchronized across the cluster. In the event that a datanode has
		to be excluded from the cluster the data that is stored on that
		datanode is already available within the cluster.</p>
	<h2><a href="http://oozie.apache.org/" target="_blank">Oozie</a></h2>
	<p>To run a chain of processes together it can be difficult , Oozie
		is technology that provides workflow functionality to the processes
		available in hadoop. A workflow can contain many actions/processes and
		it is often important to run each process sequentially. Oozie provides
		this functionality</p>
	<p>To build a workflow, actions have to be generated and configured
		and linked to other actions.</p>
