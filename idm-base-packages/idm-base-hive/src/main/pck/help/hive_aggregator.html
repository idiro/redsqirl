		<li>Group By - Group the dataset by a selection of features</li>
		<li>Features - Select the features to be used or calculated</li>
		<li>Filter - Filter the selected data by a condition</li>

			Select</a> , <a class="stopLink" id="help_hive_join"

		hadoop implementation of a relational database that is used for data
		warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in it's own

		datasets quicker and more efficient
