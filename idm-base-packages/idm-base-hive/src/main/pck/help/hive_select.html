			Select</p>

		<h2>Filters - Page 1</h2>

			hadoop implementation of a relational database that is used for data
			warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in it's own
			language called HiveQl that acts like a normal SQL query but runs as
			a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is made easier and makes querying large
			datasets quicker and more efficient
