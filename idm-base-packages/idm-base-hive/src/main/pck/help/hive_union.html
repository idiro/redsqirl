		hadoop implementation of a relational database that is used for data
		warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in it's own
		language called HiveQl that acts like a normal SQL query but runs as
		a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is made easier and makes querying large
		datasets quicker and more eficient
