		</ul>

		<h2>Source</h2>

			types Hive Table or Hive Partition. Any number of inputs are allowed
			in Hive Join as long as there is at least one</p>

			hadoop implementation of a relational database that is used for data
			warehousing for large data sets. Each query written in it's own

			a Map/Reduce job. Indexing is made easier and makes querying large
			datasets quicker and more efficient.
