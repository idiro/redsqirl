	<h1>IDM Pig</h1>
	<p>
	    Idm Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
	    href="http://pig.apache.org/" target="_blank">Pig</a> on the IDM platform to perform
	    Pig actions. The actions currently available on the package are:
	    <ul>
		<li>Pig Select</li>
		<li>Pig Aggregator</li>
		<li>Pig Join</li>
		<li>Pig Union</li>
	    </ul>	
	</p>

	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that
	consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
	programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
	The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
	amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
	to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
	infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of
	Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations
	already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's language layer
	currently consists of a textual language called Pig Latin, which has
	the following key properties:

	<ul>
	    <li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
	    execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
	    Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations
	    are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to
	    write, understand, and maintain.</li>
	    <li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
	    encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically,
	    allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.</li>
	    <li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
	    special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
