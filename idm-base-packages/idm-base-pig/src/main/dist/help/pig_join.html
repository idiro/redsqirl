		<h1>Pig Join</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Pig Join is an action allow you to join any number of relations
			together. A single type of join is performed through all the
			relations and the relations are joined one after the other in the
			order specified. The type of join supported are JOIN, LEFT OUTER
			JOIN,RIGHT OUTER JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN.</p>
		<h2>Source</h2>
		<p>The Source can be only HDFS (TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY). It has
			to be a delimiter separated value. An example is when | is the
			delimiter then the format for a line would be (X|Y|Z)</p>

		<h2>Operations - Page 1</h2>

		<h3>Operations</h3>
		<p>Selecting and performing operations on features to be copied to
			the output. Each Attribute of the data sources can be modified or
			formatted to other forms when the join is being performed</p>

		<h2>Relationship - Page 2</h2>
		<p>Specify the relationship the data sources have between each
			other</p>
		<h3>Join Type</h3>
		<p>Selecting the type of join to be performed</p>
		<h3>Join Relationship</h3>
		<p>Specify the relationship the data sources have by selecting the
			column titles that share a relationship</p>
		<h2>Select - Page 3</h2>
		<h3>Filter Interaction</h3>
		<p>Add filters to the join to get specific data that meets the
			filters rules</p>

		<h2>IDM Pig</h2>
		<p>
			Idm Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
				href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the IDM platform to perform
			Pig actions. There are two other actions available from this package
			<a href="pig_select.html">Pig Select</a> , <a href="pig_union.html">Pig
				Union</a> and <a href="pig_sample.html">Pig Sample</a>
		<p>On the last page of every pig action will have two interactions
			that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
			to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
			the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
			REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY</p>

	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of
		Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations
		already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's language layer
		currently consists of a textual language called Pig Latin, which has
		the following key properties:
	
		<ul>
		<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
			execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
			Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations
			are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to
			write, understand, and maintain.</li>
		<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
			encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically,
			allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.</li>
		<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
			special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
