	<h1>Pig Select</h1>
	<h2>Descriptiom</h2>
	<p>Perform an select satement over a data set that is stored as an
		hdfs file/MapReduce file.</p>
	<h2>Source</h2>
	<p>The Source can be only HDFS (TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY). It has
		to be a delimiter separated value. An example is when | is the
		delimiter then the format for a line would be (X|Y|Z)</p>
	<h2>Select - Page 1</h2>
	<p>This page lets filters/conditions to be set over the dataset
		that is being imported from.</p>
	<h3>Condition</h3>
	<p>Conditions can be set to filter out the data of interest. The
		query can be as complicated and complex as needed.</p>
	<h3>Group By</h3>
	<p>The attribute that the group by action can be set here which is
		the same as group by in an SQL statement.</p>
	<h2>Feature operations</h2>
	<p>Perform operations on data to transform/format the data into a
		desired output</p>

	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p>Add filters for the query to filter out the data that is desired
		and needed.</p>
		
			<h2>IDM Pig</h2>
	<p>
		Idm Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
			href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the IDM platform to perform
		Pig actions. There are two other actions available from this package <a
			href="pig_join.html">Pig Join</a> and <a href="pig_union.html">Pig
			Union</a>
	</p>
	<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that
		consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
		programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
		The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
		amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
		to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
		infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of
		Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations
		already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's language layer
		currently consists of a textual language called Pig Latin, which has
		the following key properties:
	<ul>
		<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
			execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
			Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations
			are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to
			write, understand, and maintain.</li>
		<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
			encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically,
			allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.</li>
		<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
			special-purpose processing.</li>
	</ul>
