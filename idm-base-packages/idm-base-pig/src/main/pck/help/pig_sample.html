		<h1>Pig Sample</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Perform an sample statement over a data set that is stored as
			an hdfs file/binary MapReduce file.</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Input - Single Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory</li>
			<li>Sample - Select the rate at to sample by</li>
			<li>Output - Single Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Source</h2>
		<p>The Source can be only HDFS (TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY). It has
			to be a delimiter separated value. An example is when | is the
			delimiter then the format for a line would be (X|Y|Z)</p>

		<h2>Sample - Page 1</h2>
		<p>This page lets operations be perfomed over the data .</p>
		<h3>Sample</h3>
		<p>Sample data giving a precent as input</p>

		<h2>IDM Pig</h2>
		<p>
			Idm Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
				target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the IDM platform to perform
			Pig actions. There are two other actions available from this package
			<a class="stopLink" id="help_pig_select"
				onclick="return false;" href="pig_select.html">Pig Select</a> , <a
				class="stopLink" id="help_pig_join" onclick="return false;"
				href="pig_join.html">Pig Join</a>, <a class="stopLink"
				id="help_pig_union" onclick="return false;" href="pig_union.html">Pig
				Union</a> and <a class="stopLink" id="help_pig_aggregator"
				onclick="return false;" href="pig_aggregator.html">Pig Aggregator</a>
		<p>On the last page of every pig action will have two interactions
			that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
			to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
			the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
			REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY</p>
		</p>


		<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that
			consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
			programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
			The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
			amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
			to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
			infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
			of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
			implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
			language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
			Latin, which has the following key properties:
		<ul>
			<li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
				execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
				Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
				transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
				making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
			<li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
				encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
				automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
				efficiency.</li>
			<li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
				special-purpose processing.</li>
		</ul>
