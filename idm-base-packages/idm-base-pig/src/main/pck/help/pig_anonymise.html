    <h1>Pig Transpose</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The transpose action is similar to a Matrix transpose.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input - Single Text or Binary Map Reduce Directory</li>
        <li>Parallel - Degree of parallelization</li>
        <li>A txt file '\001' delimited</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>IDM Pig</h2>
    <p>
        Idm Pig is a package that contains actions that interface with <a
            target="_blank" href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> on the IDM platform to perform
        Pig actions. There are five other actions available from this package
        <a class="stopLink" id="help_pig_select"
            onclick="return false;" href="pig_select.html">Pig Select</a> , <a
            class="stopLink" id="help_pig_join" onclick="return false;"
            href="pig_join.html">Pig Join</a>, <a class="stopLink"
            id="help_pig_union" onclick="return false;" href="pig_union.html">Pig
            Union</a>, <a class="stopLink"
            id="help_pig_transpose" onclick="return false;" href="pig_transpose.html">Pig
            Transpose</a> and <a class="stopLink" id="help_pig_aggregator"
            onclick="return false;" href="pig_aggregator.html">Pig Aggregator</a>
    <p>On the last page of every pig action will have two interactions
        that set the output format of the pig action. These interactions are
        to set the delimiter of the file for a TEXT MAP REDUCE DIRECTORY and
        the other is to set the output type of the file to be either TEXT MAP
        REDUCE DIRECTORY or BINARY MAP-REDUCE DIRECTORY</p>

    <p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that
        consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
        programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.
        The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is
        amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
        to handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's
        infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences
        of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
        implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject). Pig's
        language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig
        Latin, which has the following key properties:
    <ul>
        <li>Ease of programming. It is trivial to achieve parallel
            execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.
            Complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data
            transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences,
            making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.</li>
        <li>Optimization opportunities. The way in which tasks are
            encoded permits the system to optimize their execution
            automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than
            efficiency.</li>
        <li>Extensibility. Users can create their own functions to do
            special-purpose processing.</li>
    </ul>
