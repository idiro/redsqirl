	<h3>WHAT IS <span style="color:#c4161c">RED</span> SQIRL?</h3>

<br/><br/>

  Red Sqirl is a web-based application that is designed to construct
data workflows for processing. 
These processes will run on a Hadoop cluster. 
<br/>
The purpose of Red Sqirl is to enable data analysts to create workflows and run evaluations
on large-scale datasets using Hadoop. 
<br/>
These operations can be achieved by
running Pig/HiveQL commands or other hadoop base technology through Oozie. 
<br/>
To create a simple workflow, an analyst would drag and drop actions
  onto the GUI workspace to perform operations like import ,
 filter and many more , then they connect and configure them.
<br/>
This workflow  would then read, modify and write data within the HDFS/Hive
tables.
