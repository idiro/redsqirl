	<h1>Actions Footer</h1>
	<h2>Tabs</h2>
	<p>
		Tabs are a way of ordering and organizing actions together. Many tabs
		can be created to hold actions. It may be a good idea to add actions
		to a tab that may be used often in the same type of workflow.
		The action footer can be updated with your concent each time a
		new package installation have been detected. </p>
