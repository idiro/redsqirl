  <h2>SNA Workflow</h2>

  

  <p>This workflow will introduce the SNA
  package and how an SNA action can be compete. The data that is
  used is called &ldquo;sna.txt&rdquo; and is provided in the
  &ldquo;/tmp/&rdquo; folder on keane. Once this file has been
  copied onto hadoop&rsquo;s fs , create a new workflow and add a
  source with this file. For the Header of the file use this
  configuration &ldquo;A INT , B INT , Weight INT&rdquo;. The
  actions for the SNA Package need to be added to the actions
  footer. The actions are page rank , line rank and effective
  closeness .</p>

  

  <ul>
    <li>Once source is added and the actions
    are available in the actions footer drag a new page rank action
    to the canvas</li>

    <li>create a link between the source and
    the new page rank action.</li>

    <li>open the page rank action and change
    the id if required.</li>

    <li>the first page contains three
    interactions which identify the three attributes for the
    algorithm.</li>

    <li>for the &ldquo;A&rdquo; interaction
    select the &ldquo;A&rdquo; column from the drop down
    menu</li>

    <li>for the &ldquo;B&rdquo; interaction
    select the &ldquo;B&rdquo; column from the drop down
    menu</li>

    <li>the weight is optional in page rank but
    for this workflow select &ldquo;Weight&rdquo; in the drop down
    list and click next</li>

    <li>the &ldquo;Configurations&rdquo;
    interaction allows for parameters to be modified for the
    algorithm , page rank has two : damping and
    workers.</li>

    <li>For more information click the help
    link for page rank under the help tab for information about
    what each property.</li>

    <li>click ok and then save and run the
    workflow</li>
  </ul>
